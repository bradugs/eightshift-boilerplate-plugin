# Infinum WordPress Plugin Boilerplate

This repository contains all the tools you need to start building a modern WordPress plugin, using all the latest front end development tools.

## Getting started

The Boilerplate can be installed directly into your plugins folder "as-is". You will want to rename it and the classes inside of it to fit your needs. 

Run bash script to setup your project and rename all files via wizard.
**You run this first and only once**

```
sh _rename.sh
```

After you are done renaming the plugin to fit your needs move it to you WordPress project.
Plugins should go inside `wp-content/plugins` folder.


## Activation
It's safe to activate the plugin at this point. Because the Boilerplate has no real functionality there will be no menu items, meta boxes, or custom post types added until you write the code.

## Note
For all important stuff refer to the Readme.md file inside the plugin.
